      <description>A unit of Aspect Exarchs is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner.
However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in a unit with this Special Rule must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. An Aspect Exarch not assigned in this way is immediately slain.
Each Exarch may only be assigned to a unit without the Character Sub-type (or the Phoenix Lord Unit Type) which possesses the corresponding Aspect Shrine (X) Special Rule. No more than one Exarch may be assigned to any given unit in this manner.
Once assigned to a unit, the Exarch is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances. In battles using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing an Exarch as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, an Exarch does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

      <description>However, their numbers dwindled due to their newfound existence, and when forced to mass in numbers against some dire threat, they were forced to draw upon the greater Craftworld population in the hope of assembling a force capable of combating the enemy.
The notation in brackets that is included as part of the Aspect Shrine (X) Special Rule defines which Aspect Shrine the model belongs to. This Aspect Shrine influences how it may be selected when building an army that incorporates a Detachment with the Asuryani Sub-faction.
When selecting a detachment using the Asuryani Army List, the number of units from Aspect Shrines is limited; for each model included in a Detachment with the Character Sub-Type (or the Phoenix Lord Unit Type) and a given version of the Aspect Shrine (X) Special Rule (for example, Aspect Shrine (Dire Avenger)), the Detachment may include up to one other unit without the Character Sub-type (or the Phoenix Lord Unit Type) with the corresponding Aspect Shrine (X) Special Rule. Units taken this way are still limited to available Force Organisation slots. Note that Dedicated Transports do not count towards these limits.</description>

      <description>Whilst not traditionally warriors, those that were summoned to war were a vital resource only assigned in necessity, placed amongst kin that could best benefit from their capabilities.
A Bonesinger Conclave is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner.
However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in a Bonesinger Conclave must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of.
Bonesingers may only be assigned to units of Guardian Defenders, Storm Guardians, or Vaul&apos;s Wrath Support Batteries. No more than one Bonesinger may be assigned to any given unit.
Once assigned to a unit, the Bonesinger is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances – if the unit is removed as a casualty, then the Bonesinger is removed as well. In battles using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing a Bonesinger as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, a Bonesinger gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

      <description>Models with this Special Rule in a unit which contains multiple models with this Special Rule may not cast Psychic Powers as normal - instead, all applicable models must cast as a group.
Whenever the unit attempts to cast a Psychic Power, the majority Leadership Characteristic must be used. Whenever a power is manifested by the unit, you must pick a single model to be the ‘originating’ model – this is only to represent the lead caster, and is for the purposes of measuring ranges and so on. In addition, the unit’s starting size and casualties taken affecting the number of models remaining influences Special Rules the unit has, as below; •    If a unit contains 1-3 models with this Special Rule, all models in the unit with this Special Rule gain the Psychic Mastery (1) Special Rule, and lose any other variant of the Psychic Mastery (X) Special Rule they possessed.
•    If a unit contains 4-6 models with this Special Rule, all models in the unit with this Special Rule gain the Psychic Mastery (2) Special Rule, and lose any other variant of the Psychic Mastery (X) Special Rule they possessed.
•    If a unit contains 7-10 models with this Special Rule, all models in the unit with this Special Rule gain the Psychic Mastery (3) Special Rule, and lose any other variant of the Psychic Mastery (X) Special Rule they possessed.
Any models in the unit without the Communion of Minds Special Rule are unaffected.</description>

      <description>A unit with this Special Rule may make a Flickerjump Advanced Reaction:
Flickerjump - Advanced Reaction This Advanced Reaction may be made during the Opposing Player’s Shooting Phase when any enemy unit declares a Shooting Attack targeting a friendly unit composed entirely of models with the Flickerjump Special Rule.
Before resolving the Shooting Attack, the unit targeted by the Shooting Attack may make an immediate Move 2D6&apos;&apos; in any direction. This distance is not affected by any modifiers, whether positive or negative. If the result of the 2D6&quot; roll is a double 1, one model from the Reaction unit is immediately removed as a casualty.
Once the move is resolved, if the Shooting Attack is no longer valid (due to the enemy unit no longer having line of sight to the target or being out of range, for example) then the Active player may not select a different target and no attacks are made or dice rolled for that unit.</description>

If a weapon with this Special Rule places another Large Blast (5&quot;) marker within 3&quot; of the original Blast marker, the Controlling Player may instead resolve the attack with an Apocalyptic Blast (10&quot;) marker, instead of a Large Blast (5&quot;) marker.

      <description>Whenever a unit containing more than one model armed with weapons with this Special Rule is elected to make a shooting attack in the Controlling Player’s Shooting Phase, the unit may declare it is combining its fire rather than attacking normally. If you do so, select one model in the unit. No other models in the unit may make Shooting Attacks with a weapon with this Special Rule during the Controlling Player’s Shooting Phase.
The selected model may then make a shooting attack with a weapon it is equipped with which has the Ghostlight Special Rule.
If the weapon has multiple profiles with the Ghostlight Special Rule, you must select one of them to use. If only one of multiple profiles has the Ghostlight Special Rule, only that profile may be used for the combined fire attack.
In addition, for each two additional models in the unit equipped with a weapon with the Ghostlight Special Rule, you may apply one of the below bonuses to the attack. Note that these bonuses may only be claimed if the friendly models in the unit can see the selected model which is making the shooting attack, and you may select the same bonus multiple times:
•     Increase the Range of the Profile by 6&quot; •     Increase the Strength of the Profile by +1 (to a maximum of 10) •     Decrease the AP of the Profile by -1 (to a minimum of 1) •     Increase the number of shots by 1 Guardian Artillerists Whether due to ease-of-use or practised familiarity, these Guardians were highly capable with the employment of artillery. These trained individuals knew best how to place each shot from their platforms to deadly effect.
A Vaul’s Wrath Support Battery must have one Guardian Crew per Support Weapon in order for all Support Weapons to make Shooting Attacks in the Shooting phase. If, at the start of any of the controlling player’s Shooting phases, the Vaul’s Wrath Support Battery contains fewer Guardian Crew than Support Weapons, then only a number of Support Weapons equal to the number of Guardian Crew may make Shooting Attacks in that Shooting phase. In addition, as long as there are at least as many Guardian Crew in the unit as there are Support Weapons, then the unit cannot be Pinned, automatically passing any Pinning test it is called upon to take without any dice being rolled (this benefit is immediately lost once the number of Guardian Crew is reduced to less than the number of Support Weapons in the unit).</description>

      <description>A Guardian Officer Cadre is selected as any other unit, using up a single Force Organisation slot and bought in the same manner.
However, before the first turn begins and any models are deployed to the battlefield, all models in a Guardian Officer Cadre must be assigned to another unit from the same Detachment of the army they were selected as part of. If a unit with this Special Rule contains three or more models during the list creation stage, it does not use up a Force Organisation slot.
Guardian Officers may only be assigned to units of Guardian Defenders, Storm Guardians, or Vaul&apos;s Wrath Support Batteries.
Skyrunner Officers may only be assigned to units of Windriders or Windrider Support Squads. No more than one Guardian Officer or Skyrunner Officer may be assigned to any given unit.
Once assigned to a unit, the Guardian Officer or Skyrunner Officer is considered part of that unit and may not leave it under any circumstances – however, if they are the sole survivor of an attack they may continue to function as normal. In battles using Victory points, no Victory points are ever scored for removing a Guardian Officer or Skyrunner Officer as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, a Guardian Officer or Skyrunner Officer gains all of the special rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional Wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

If the weapon has multiple profiles with the Linked Fire Special Rule, you must select one of them to use. If only one of multiple profiles has the Linked Fire Special Rule, only that profile may be used for the Linked Fire attack.
In addition, for each additional model in the unit equipped with a weapon with the Linked Fire Special Rule, you may apply one of the below bonuses to the attack. Note that these bonuses may only be claimed if the friendly models in the unit can see the selected model which is making the Shooting Attack, and you may select the same bonus multiple times:
•     Increase the Strength of the Profile by +2 •     Increase rolls made on the Vehicle Damage table by +1 •     Increase the number of shots by +1 •     Give the Shooting Attack the Brutal (2) Special Rule (or increase an existing Brutal (X) value by +2) Mark of Kurnous To those who followed the path of the hunter, there was no greater thrill than the pursuit of a marked target.
At the start of the controlling player’s Shooting Phase, a unit with this Special Rule may select an enemy unit within 12&quot; of any model in the unit.

When rolling To Wound normally with this weapon, any non- Vehicle model that suffers a Hit from a weapon with this special rule uses the target’s Initiative Characteristic instead of its Toughness - this is rolled as per the normal to-Wound roll rules otherwise. The target unit’s Toughness characteristic is still used to determine whether the attack causes Instant Death.
In addition, any unit successfully hit by one or more models or weapons with this Special Rule must take an Initiative test once the attack is fully resolved. If failed, the unit must reduce its Initiative and Movement Characteristics by -2 until the end of their Controlling Player’s next turn. Note that the effects of this Special Rule are cumulative, and a unit can be affected by multiple sources, with the penalties to their Characteristics being applied to any further Initiative Characteristic tests they are called to make - though models with a starting Wounds Characteristic of 6 or more cannot have their Characteristics reduced as a result of this Special Rule.</description>

If a model chooses to fire in this way, they are counted as having moved - note that this may prevent them from shooting certain weapon types. It should be noted that any ability which replaces a Shooting Attack (such as, but not limited to, casting a Psychic Power or Cybertheurgic Rite) may not be used. Shooting Attacks made in this manner may target a different unit to ones made by the Transport, but any Reactions made to these target the Transport as normal. Units with any Special Rule that allows them to count as stationary for the purposes of Shooting attacks (such as Relentless, Legiones Astartes (Death Guard), etc) may not benefit from them whilst embarked on a Transport with this Special Rule.

Models with the Grav-Platform Sub-type are not affected by this Special Rule and do not gain the Feel No Pain (X) Special Rule.
At the start of the Controlling Player’s Shooting Phase, they may choose to lose the ability to confer the Feel No Pain (5+) Special Rule to the unit they are part of, and if they do so, they gain the Battlesmith (3+) Special Rule instead. They may use the Battlesmith (3+) Special Rule as normal - or may instead use it on a model with the Grav-Platform Sub-type instead to restore a single Wound lost earlier in the battle. A model with this Special Rule may choose to use the Battlesmith (3+) Special Rule to affect any applicable friendly model within 6&quot;. This effect lasts until the start of the Controlling Player’s next turn, at which point the model with this Special Rule loses the Battlesmith (3+) Special Rule and regains the Feel No Pain (5+) Special Rule.</description>

Starting on Turn 2, the Controlling Player may choose to deploy one unit assigned to a Webway Strike onto the battlefield per turn (without the need to make a Reserve roll). A unit assigned to a Webway Strike moves onto the battlefield as though the line between each Wraithbone Arch was the Controlling Player’s battlefield edge.
Once the unit is deployed, any enemy units that have one or more models within 6&quot; of any unit deployed as part of the Webway Strike must make an immediate Pinning test. Once all Pinning tests are resolved, any enemy units that are neither Pinned or Falling Back and are within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Advanced Reaction targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Webway Strike. Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of a Webway Strike.
Once a unit making a Webway Strike has been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of a Webway Strike may not Move or Run in the same movement phase as they are deployed, but may Shoot and Assault as normal.

      <description>A model with this Special Rule starts the game carrying a single Deployable Bunker, which does not use up any Force Organisation slot. This bunker is a Fortification (Building) and has Access Points on each side. It has Front, Side, and Rear Armour Values of 12, a Hull Points value of 4, a Fire Points value of (Front, 6), and a Transport Capacity of 12. This Deployable Bunker may also choose to select two Emplacement Mounted Heavy Stubbers at no additional points cost. Models may start the battle Embarked within the Deployable Bunker, but may not disembark until the Deployable Bunker is deployed, and the Deployable Bunker or its Embarked unit may not act until the Deployable Bunker is deployed.
Whenever the Kelaino Sky-Talon is eligible to have models Disembark, it may instead choose to deploy the Deployable Bunker. Place the Deployable Bunker within base contact of the Kelaino Sky-Talon. If there is no location in which the Deployable Bunker can be placed on the battlefield in which its final position is not within 1&quot; of an enemy model, Objective Marker, or Impassable Terrain, then the Deployable Bunker may not be deployed. If the Deployable Bunker may be deployed, and the model’s final position has been decided, the Deployable Bunker remains in that location for the duration of the game and is now treated as a Fortification, following all usual rules that Fortifications follow.
If a Kelaino Sky-Talon suffers the Crash and Burn damage result whilst it is carrying a Deployable Bunker, after resolving the initial Crash and Burn result (as shown on the Vehicle Damage table), resolve an additional Small Blast (3&quot;) marker using the Crash and Burn rules. The Flyer, the Deployable Bunker, and any unit that was embarked within it, are then removed from play.
Designer’s Note: The Bunker should be roughly of a size which allows it to fit on a 120 x 92mm base.</description>

The Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill is assumed to have a Transport Capacity big enough to fit any unit assigned to it. A unit with any version of the Bulky (X) Special Rule may not be assigned to either an Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill.
When an Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill arrives as part of a Subterranean Assault, place a 3&quot; Blast Marker directly beneath the model. This marker is now treated as Difficult Terrain, and the Blast Marker remains in play for the rest of the game. The Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill gains the Shrouded (5+) Special Rule for the duration of the turn it arrives.
In any of the Controlling Player’s following Movement Phases, the unit embarked upon the Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill may be deployed as though it was disembarking, measuring from any point of the Blast Marker. The unit may move up to their Movement Characteristic and may choose to Run. A unit deploying in this way cannot be the target of the Interceptor Advanced Reaction if it deploys in the Controlling Player’s first Movement Phase after the Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill has arrived. A unit can still be deployed in this way even if the Auxilia Hades Drill or Militia Hades Drill is destroyed after it has been deployed.

The squad must not exceed the total Transport Capacity of the transports in the squadron in order to do so. If a unit elects to do so, the models with this Special Rule must remain in unit coherency, effectively negating the effects of any Special Rules which would normally allow them to separate, until the squad has disembarked from all transports.
Note that the transported unit must observe coherency requirements despite disembarking from separate transports – meaning if the contents of one transport elects to disembark, all other members of the unit carried in other transports must elect to do so within coherency of the other members of the unit in the same phase. If a model transporting a unit across multiple models has one suffer a Crash and Burn result on the damage table, all models inside the destroyed transport are automatically counted as destroyed - Any models spread across other multiple models in the Squadron’s Transport Capacity must still disembark within normal unit coherency as normal. Note that no Leadership tests can be inflicted for models removed from play in this way.</description>

However, before the first turn begins, all models in a Vigilant Covenant must be assigned to another unit from another unit from the same detachment if the army they were selected as part of. Knight Vestals may only be assigned to units entirely composed of models with the Infantry Unit Type and the Silent Sisterhood (X) Special Rule.
A Knight Vestal cannot be assigned to any unit that includes one or more models with the Independent Character Special Rule or Unique Unit Sub-type (but such models may join a unit that includes a Knight Vestal as normal during either deployment or any following turn).
No more than one Knight Vestal may be assigned to any given unit. Once assigned to a unit, the Knight Vestal is considered part of that unit and may not leave under any circumstances - if that unit is removed as a casualty then the Knight Vestal is removed as well. In battles using Victory Points, no Victory Points are ever scored for removing a Knight Vestal as a casualty. When assigned to a unit, a Knight Vestal gains all of the Special Rules (with the exception of those that specifically forbid it, such as the Bitter Duty Special Rule) and Unit Sub-types listed for the unit to which it is attached, but does not gain access to any additional wargear options available to the unit to which it is assigned.</description>

      <description>If a weapon with this Special Rule successfully hits a target, but the target model is not removed from play, the target model and the firing model must both immediately roll a D6, and add their Strength Characteristic to the roll. The wielder does not use their Strength Characteristic, but instead uses the weapon’s Strength. The target should use their unmodified Strength value - models with no Strength value use their highest Armour Value instead. Compare the results, with the model with the highest result being the winner. If the target loses the test, it is immediately placed in base-to-base contact with the firing model by the shortest route, and is counted as if the firing model had just charged it in the following Assault phase. If the target wins the Strength test, it is freed from the harpoon, and no further effects occur. In the case of a drawn result, both players should re-roll their D6 and compare the results again.
Buildings and Zooming Flyers can never be affected by this Special Rule. In addition, if a model is pulled from unit coherency, its unit must move into coherency with it as soon as it is able. The whole unit counts as locked as in combat. If fired as part of an Overwatch Reaction, and a model is Snared and thus moved, the rest of the unit from which the model came may still make a Charge move, with the whole unit counted as having made a Disordered charge, and the Snared model as being the initial model for purposes of base-to-base contact.

            <characteristic typeId="347e-ee4a-764f-6be3" name="Description">Reduce the Strength characteristic of Shooting Attacks made against a unit in which the majority of models have a Tarsus Buckler by -2 (to a minimum of 1) Tenebris Praetoria Designed to obscure and confound, the Tenebris Praetoria cast out an ink-black pall - within which even the shining gold of the Custodians was rendered invisible.
Whenever targeted by a Shooting Attack, the range between an attacking unit and a unit including one or more models with a Tenebris Praetoria is considered to be 6&quot; further than the actual range between the two units – enemy units with the Night Vision Special Rule, weapons with the Template Special Rule and models with the Primarch Unit Type ignore this effect. In addition, when attacked by a weapon with the Barrage Special Rule, a unit including one or more models with a Tenebris Praetoria is always treated as though it was out of line of sight when scattering any attacks.</characteristic>

As a result, rapid innovation was required by the Bonesingers of the Craftworlds, as well as raids on old Anrathe caches to bolster existing supplies. This would result in armour wholly unique to that strand of the Aeldari race, designed from the best they could muster to defend themselves.</characteristic>

Legion Saturnine Terminator Armour The technology for Exo-Armour was originally developed during Mankind&apos;s Dark Age of Technology. These sealed environment suits enabled maintenance crews of spacecraft to operate in extremely hazardous environments such as hard vacuum, the interior of plasma or fusion reactors, and in otherwise adverse atmospheric conditions. It was from here that the Mechanicum started their work, and in short order they had created working prototypes, the first suits of which were completed shortly before the beginning of the Great Crusade.
By the end of the crusade, however, the inferno of war hungered for more materiel, and into such flames were suits old and new cast…
Legion Saturnine Terminator Armour confers a 2+ Armour Save and a 4+ Invulnerable save, as well as the Hammer of Wrath (1) Special Rule.
A unit that includes any models with Saturnine Terminator armour may not make Sweeping Advances.
In addition, a model armed with Saturnine Terminator Armour is immune to the effects of both the Rad-Phage Special Rule and of the effects of Rad Grenades and Rad Furnace wargear.</characteristic>

•     Enemy models cannot be deployed using the Infiltrate special rule within 24&quot; of a model with an Auspex Surveyor.
•     A unit that includes at least one model with an Auspex Surveyor ignores the 24&quot; limit to line of sight and the -1 penalty to Ballistic Skill when making Shooting Attacks while the Night Fighting rules are in effect.
•     When any enemy unit is deployed to the battlefield from Reserves, a unit that includes at least one model with an Auspex Surveyor may make the Interceptor Advanced Reaction (see the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook, page 309) without expending a point of the Reactive player’s Reaction Allotment. This does not allow the unit to make more than one Reaction per Phase, but does allow the controlling player to exceed the normal three Reactions limit in a given Phase.
Auxilia Tempestor Land Speeder A sub-class of the more common Proteus pattern, these vehicles featured a large suite of command and control equipment, as well as extra armour plating to further protect its human crew. Tempestor scouting vehicles roved ahead of the main force of the Auxilia, their fully environmentally-sealed nature allowing them to function as strike craft in low- or zero-gravity environments. Carrying a multitude of weaponry, the Tempestor was notoriously deadly to enemy infantry and light vehicles.
An Auxilia Tempestor Land Speeder has a Multi-Laser and a Havoc Launcher.
In addition, a model equipped with an Auxilia Tempestor Land Speeder that chooses to Run gains the Shrouded (5+) Special Rule until the start of the Controlling Player’s next turn.</characteristic>

          <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type:
•     Independent Character, Eternal Warrior, Fear (2), It Will Not Die (5+), Bulky (6), and Relentless. In addition, all models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type always count as Character models.
•     Models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type are not affected by Special Rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.
•     All models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type are immune to the effects of the Fear (X) special rule, cannot be Pinned, and a unit that includes one or more models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type automatically passes Pinning and Regroup tests and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless special rule. When a unit that includes one or more models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type fails a Morale check, the unit does not Fall Back as per the standard rules, but instead suffers D3 automatic Wounds with no Saves of any kind allowed which must be allocated to a model with the Daemon Primarch or Daemon Unit Type or the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.
•     Primarchs have the Precision Strikes (2+) and Precision Shots (2+) Special Rules, and may choose to use these rules when attacking even when ordinarily they would be prevented from doing so, including when making Snap Shots.
•     If an army includes any models with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type, then one of those models must be chosen as the army&apos;s Warlord.
•     For the purposes of any special rule that affects or has additional effects that target models with the Daemon or Primarch Unit Type, a model with the Daemon Primarch Unit Type is considered to have the Daemon and Primarch Unit Types.
•     Any unit entirely composed of models with the Primarch Unit Type may choose to ignore the Heroic Stand Special Rule, ignoring any penalties normally applied for declining a Challenge, unless the Challenge was issued by a model with the Knight, Gargantuan, Titan, Primarch, or Daemon Primarch Unit Types.</description>

          <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Phoenix Lord Unit Type:
•     All Phoenix Lords have the following Special Rules: Independent Character, Eternal Warrior, Fearless, Relentless, Favoured of Khaine, and Path of Command. In addition, all models with the Phoenix Lord unit type always count as Character models.
•     Phoenix Lords are not affected by Special Rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, Phoenix Lords always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.
•     Phoenix Lords have the Precision Strikes (2+) and Precision Shots (2+) Special Rules, and may choose to use these rules when attacking even when ordinarily they would be prevented from doing so, including when making Snap Shots.
•     If an army includes any Phoenix Lord models, then one of those models must be chosen as the army’s Warlord.
•     Any unit entirely composed of models with the Phoenix Lord Unit Type may choose to ignore the Heroic Stand Special Rule, ignoring any penalties normally applied for declining a Challenge, unless the Challenge was issued by a model with the Knight, Gargantuan, Titan, Primarch, or Daemon Primarch Unit Types.
•     Any attacks made or effects applied against a unit with the Phoenix Lord Unit Type are resolved as if the Phoenix Lord had the Primarch Unit Type, for the purposes of resolving these attacks. Note that this affects any Wargear, Weapons, Special Rules, Psychic Powers, or any other abilities.
•     A model with this Unit Type may join units and embark upon Transports as though it had the Infantry Unit Type.
•     A unit containing at least one model with this Unit Type may take Shrouded Damage Mitigation rolls as though it did not have the Fearless Special Rule, in the same manner as the Primarch Unit Type.
•     For the purposes of any Wargear or Special Rules which state that models with the Primarch Unit Type may ignore their effects, count a model with the Phoenix Lord Unit Type as having the Primarch Unit Type.</description>

          <description>These Wraiths were seen by many as necromantic perversions; but necessity called, and all eventually accepted that only those Eldar brave enough to accept their use were likely to survive the onrushing darkness…
The following rules apply to all models with the Wraith Sub-type:
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type are subject to the Wraithsight provision. At the start of each of the Controlling Player’s Movement Phases, a unit which includes any models with the Wraith Sub-type must take a Leadership test, using the unmodified Leadership Characteristic of a model in the unit which has the Wraith Sub-type. Models which are not on the board at the start of the Controlling Player’s Movement Phase, but which are Deployed or Disembark after the start of the Phase must test immediately after being Deployed or Disembarking.
A unit which passes suffers no negative penalty, and in addition may react as normal, ignoring the limitations imposed from the Automata Unit Type, until the start of the Controlling Player’s next Movement Phase. A unit which fails the Leadership test suffers a -2 modifier to its Movement, Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Initiative, which is also applied to any Rules or Restrictions that call for a unit&apos;s unmodified Characteristics, until the start of the Controlling Player’s next Movement Phase.
•     A model with the Wraith Unit Sub-type may fire all weapons they are equipped with in each Shooting Attack they make, including as part of a Reaction, where eligible.
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type may fire Heavy and Ordnance weapons and count as Stationary even if they moved in the preceding Movement phase, and may declare Charges as normal regardless of any Shooting Attacks made in the same turn.
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type ignore the effects of Night Fighting.
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type ignore any penalties to their Initiative Characteristic when Charging into or through Difficult Terrain or Dangerous Terrain.
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type cannot be affected by any Cybertheurgic Rites, and ignore any effects imposed by them.
•     Models with the Wraith Unit Sub-type ignore the effects of the Disruption and Haywire Special Rules.
•     You may only include up to two units with the Wraith Unit Sub-type for each model with the Path of the Dead Special Rule in the same Detachment.</description>

          <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Anathema Sub-type:
•     A unit that includes at least one model with the Anathema Sub-type may not be directly targeted by any Psychic Power or use any Psychic Power or make attacks with a Psychic Weapon. Psychic Powers whose effects would otherwise be applied to a unit that includes at least one model with the Anathema Sub-type (due to area of effect, scattering or other rules) have no effect, but are not cancelled and may continue to affect other units.
•     A model with the Anathema Sub-type that is allocated Wounds caused by a Psychic Weapon (which is any weapon granted to a unit or model by a Psychic Discipline) will always fail to Wound without any dice being rolled and any special rules attached to that Psychic Weapon will not trigger. Any Wounds allocated to a model with the Anathema Unit Sub-type caused by a Force Weapon gain no benefit from the Force, Achean Force, or Soul Tear Special Rules, but are otherwise resolved as normal. These effects do not apply to a model with the Transport Sub-type that has models with the Anathema Sub-type Embarked within, unless the model with the Transport Sub-type also has the Anathema Sub-type.
•     All models that do not have the Anathema Sub-type, but are part of a unit that includes one or more models with the Anathema Sub-type, suffer a penalty of -2 to their Leadership Characteristic, and models with the Anathema Sub-type suffer a penalty of -1 to their Leadership. Any unit with at least one model within 6&quot; of a model with the Anathema Sub-type suffers a penalty of -1 to the Leadership of all models in that unit that do not also have the Anathema Sub-type, or -2 if that unit includes one or more models with the Corrupted or Psyker Sub-types, or the Daemon Unit Type. Note that these two penalties are not cumulative; they apply only the most severe penalty. However, they do stack with other Special Rules that modify Leadership (such as the Fear (X) Special Rule).
•     A unit that is Embarked on a Vehicle, Fortification or Building suffers no penalties to its Leadership Characteristic due to the Anathema Sub- type. However, units with the Stubborn Special Rule do suffer penalties to their Leadership from the effects of this Sub-type (note that this only applies to the Stubborn Special Rule, and other special rules that ignore penalties to Leadership ignore the effects of the Anathema Sub-type).</description>

          <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Corrupted Sub-type:
•     All models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type gain the Fear (1) Special Rule.
•     Any Hits inflicted on a model with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type by a weapon with the Force or Psychic Focus Special Rules gain the Instant Death Special Rule.
•     Any unit composed entirely of models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type is immune to the effects of the Fear (X) Special Rule, automatically passes Regroup tests, and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless Special Rule. When a unit composed entirely of models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type fails a Morale check it does not Fall Back as per the standard rules, but instead suffers D3 automatic Wounds with no saves or Damage Mitigation rolls of any kind allowed.
•     No unit that does not also have the Corrupted Unit Sub-type or the Daemon Unit Type may join a unit that includes one or more models with the Corrupted Unit Sub-type.</description>

          <description>The following rules apply to all models with the Guardian Sub-type:

•     Units including models with the Guardian Unit Sub-type may be joined by friendly models with the Character Unit Sub-type or Independent Character Special Rule, and when they are joined in this manner may make Reactions, even if their Unit Type would normally restrict this.
•     If a unit contains any models with the Guardian Unit Sub-type as well as one or more models with the Character Unit Sub-type, any Wounds which would be allocated to the Character (even those caused by the Precision Strikes (X) or Sniper Special Rules) may instead be allocated to a model with the Guardian Unit Sub-type first.
•     Unless they are joined by a friendly Character, all models with the Guardian Unit Sub-type suffer the following provisions:
- Reduce their Movement Characteristic by -2 and may not Run.
- Reduce their Initiative Characteristic to 1.</description>
